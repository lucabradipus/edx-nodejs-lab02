Module 2 assignment lab in edX introduction to NodeJS

**Testing**

after npm install you can run either
    
    npm test  
or 
    
    ./node_modules/.bin/mocha  
        

I tried to learn something about testing using Mocha, chai, chai-http and super-agent 


**running**

You cannot execute **npm test** when the server is running because testing launches its own server on the same port
